There are infinite lines of code that all do different thing but when you put them together they make a program.My interest in IT started in year 11 and 12 when I started taking information technology which I learnt the basics of programming and coding like Hello World. When I started going to my classes and learning new things, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in IT.</p>
								<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p> 
								<p>The reason I choose to come to RMIT was because I got an offer from RMIT and also my year 12 career advisers suggested RMIT to me because it offer a different range of qualifications like you can do you certificate, diploma or advances diploma and if you want to you can continues studying and do you bachelors, honours and master degree.</p>
								<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
								<p> During my studies, I expect to learn to get better at solving problems and learn more about programing and coding. I want to learn how to program and make  professional website for bigger business who want to branch out to online advertising, as I want to be a web developer as my future career. </p>

						 <!-- Project ideas -->
							<article id="Projectideas">
								<h2 class="major">Project ideas</h2>
								<p>What the project will be?</p>
								<p>My project idea is a create a mobile app, the mobile app would be based on lost property, that can be used only by business, companies, school and University. The app can help the people inside or outside the business (employees or customers), companies (employees or customers), school (stuff or student) and University (stuff or student) find there lost their valuable or items. The app is useful because it can help lose the hustle of going back to the business, companies, school and University to find their lost valuable or items. If the owner of the item is found they should have an evidence of ownership. </p>
								<p>Description of why the project will be interesting or useful?</p>
								<p>The mobile app that I’m creating can be useful for people who has a habit of losing thing or forgetting things at places it will be easy for them to find their stuff, where they left their valuable or items by just checking the app if anyone has handed it to the lost property. As my own personal experience in high school I have lost most of my thing but mostly I have lost my USB and I used to go to the library or the lost property once a week to check if my USB would be there that would kind of bothered me to go to the library and have look, if the school had an app with they could listed the thing student have lost, that would make my life easier by just check on the app instead of physically going. </p>
								<p>Description of the features of the product or service?</p>
								<p>The features that my App application would have is sign up page, login page and notification button. The sign-up page would be simple to follow and to make an account first you filling some of your details like first name, last name, phone number and  verification code will be send to the phone number which they need to type it in for security purpose , Personal email verification code will be send to personal email which they need to type it in security purpose , category for example if it business, school or company and they need to fill in the category detail like if they are sign up for a school, business or company they need to put in the name of the school, business or the companies.The sign-up page would contain username or email and password to sign in and a button for forgot user name and forgot password just in case they don't remember their user name and password and sign in button so when they click in the sign in button t can process and open their account and a tick the box button where it says remember my account, so they don’t have to log in every time if they don't want to, they can just be log in all the time if they tick the box. In the setting, there will be a notification button where they can adjust it if they want to see the notification by truing the notification button on. The notification will notify if there is any new lost item has been added to the app or any update has been made and they will be notified and if they only turn the button on then only they will be notified other ways if the button is off they will be not notified and they have to check the app for any update or if any new items has been added.When you log in into your account there will be button where it will have items and when you click on the items button you will have sub menu of different category of items for example, there will be a phone, watches and USB and when you click on one of them you for example if you click on the USB sub menu you will see how many USB is there and if yours is there.Another feature I’ll add is a location button which is up to the owner of the account if they want to they can turn the location on and the app will know the location and if they lose something they can check where the last place they went to and if they don't want the location they can just leave it off and no location and be tracked and this will be a simple application just to get started on the project more feature can be add afterwards when once our customer uses the mobile application and we can ask there feedback on what needs to be improved or added to the mobile application. </p>
								<p>Describe of the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed?</p>
								<p>First thing you need is to have a mobile application developer who know how to code and make a mobile application. The hardware that we need to develop this app is a laptop or a computer from Mac or windows or from any company. The laptop or computer should have enough storage to download the program that you will be using for coding the mobile application and an android phone to test the app at each stage. The software that we will be using to develop this mobile app is android studio, which we can download it from google for free.</p>
								<p>List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware?</p>
								<p>The skills Required for developing the mobile application is that you need to know to how to use the android studio and when testing the application, you should know how to connect the hardware which is the phone to android studio to test the application at each stage to see if the app is working the way you planned to work and how the application look on an mobile and the other  skill Required for developing the mobile application is someone who needs to be good at coding for mobile application and get the basic thing we want in a app.It will be easy to find the hardware and software because we already have the hardware and software but when it comes to the skills it would be hard to find because as myself I really don’t have the skills to develop an application own my own I will need someone’s help who good at developing mobile application.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
								<p>If my project is successful the outcome will be huge. For one it will be less of a hassle to find you lost belongings. because of going to the store or business you can just get on our app find the store or business and try and find you lost belongings and my mobile application will solve the original problem, it will do this by making it easier to find and retrieve your item you have lost thus solving my original problem. If my mobile app is successful there will probably be more applications like my own in development.</p>
